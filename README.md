An endless runner game by Kristina Petrova and Matthew Johnson

The idea behind this game is that the sea level rises unless you continue to collect the plastic bottles. When these are deposited in the bin the sea level drops depending on how many bottles you have collected.

All game assets are open source or created by ourselves.

The game features a day and night cycle with different assets for each.

The music will be reactive to the game and low pass filter as sea level rises

we used vectors for the random rain and sparks effect when the character hits the bin.

we implemented gravity on the character and gravity and random wind conditions on the rain

We check for the type of device running the game and use different display settings depending on the result.

We used spritesheets for the splash and explosion effects

Implemented parallax scrolling on the back ground

used ImageMagick to automate create different length platforms

all the platforms, bottles, bins, and clouds are dynamically generated within the game - no two plays are the same!

We created this game with the P5.js library

the game works kind of on mobile

future features:
original music

scoreboard
original graphics
probably something else

an upto date deployment is available at:https://climaterunner.netlify.app/
